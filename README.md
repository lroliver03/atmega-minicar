# atMEGA Minicar

A small college project for an embedded remote-controlled car powered by an ATmega328P microprocessor and onboard batteries.

The ATmega328P will come in an Arduino Uno board powered by two lithium-ion cells. For remote communication, the [HC-50 Bluetooth to Serial module](../main/hardware/documentation/HC-05%20Datasheet.pdf) will be used and commands will have a standardized syntax (TBD).
